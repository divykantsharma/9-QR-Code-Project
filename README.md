# 9-QR-Code-Project
Made this project with the help of JavaScript using concepts of NodeJS which included use of Native Node Modules and Node Package Manager (NPM).

-> This code demonstrates the usage of the Node.js modules inquirer, qr-image, and fs to create a command-line program that prompts the user to enter a URL, generates a QR code image based on the URL, and saves the URL and the QR code image to files.

-> Advantages : 
1. Cross-platform compatibility: JavaScript and Node.js are widely supported across various platforms, making it possible to generate QR codes on different operating systems.
2. Easy integration: npm packages provide pre-built functionality, allowing you to easily incorporate QR code generation into your JavaScript projects without having to implement the entire QR code generation algorithm from scratch.
3. Abundance of community-supported packages: npm is the largest package registry for JavaScript, providing a vast collection of community-developed packages. You can find multiple QR code generation libraries, like qrcode, that have been thoroughly tested, documented, and maintained by the community.
4. Customization options: QR code generator packages often offer a range of customization options, such as size, error correction level, colors, and embedded logos. This allows you to tailor the appearance and behavior of the generated QR codes to suit your specific needs.
5. Simplicity and convenience: Using a QR code generator package simplifies the process of generating QR codes. You can leverage the built-in functions and methods provided by the package, eliminating the complexity of implementing the QR code generation algorithm manually.
6. Efficiency and performance: QR code generator packages are typically optimized for performance, providing efficient algorithms for generating QR codes quickly and accurately. This ensures that the QR code generation process is fast and doesn't impact the overall performance of your application.
7. Integration with other modules and libraries: JavaScript and Node.js offer a vast ecosystem of modules and libraries. By using a QR code generator package, you can easily integrate QR code generation with other functionalities or frameworks in your JavaScript projects, leveraging the power of the JavaScript ecosystem.
8. Overall, using a QR code generator with JavaScript and Node.js, along with npm packages, offers a streamlined and efficient way to incorporate QR code generation into your projects, saving development time and effort while benefiting from community support and customization options.

-> Overall, this code allows users to enter a URL, generates a QR code image based on the URL, and saves the URL and QR code image to separate files.
